The Allen Coral Atlas was conceived and funded by the late Paul Allen’s Vulcan Inc. and is managed by the Arizona State University Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science. Along with partners from Planet, the University of Queensland, and the National Geographic Society, the Atlas utilizes high-resolution satellite imagery and advanced analytics to map and monitor the world’s coral reefs in unprecedented detail. These products support coral reef science, management, conservation, and policy across the planet. This tool is designed to help interact programmatically with the Allen Coral Atlas and is not based on any official API so expect features to break once in a while.
