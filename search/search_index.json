Along with partners from Planet, the University of Queensland, and the National Geographic Society, the Atlas utilizes high-resolution satellite imagery and advanced analytics to map and monitor the world\u2019s coral reefs in unprecedented detail. These products support coral reef science, management, conservation, and policy across the planet.
